# Notes on Iamus Architecture and Design

## Routing

[ExpressJS] routing is built at run time. The routine `createAPIRouter()`
in `index.ts` imports all the `.js` files in the given directory
and, if they present a `Router` export, that route is added to
a new router. This builds a router that routes to all the routers
defined in the directory tree.

Each of the processors for MetaverseAPI requests is processed as a
stream with processors for setting up the actual action of the request.
The parameters for the final action are variables added to the passed
request. See `RequestAdditions.ts` for the definition of the additional
variables added to the Request object.

As an example:

```javascript
router.delete('/api/v1/account/:accountId/tokens/:tokenId',
                    [ setupMetaverseAPI,      // req.vRestReq
                      accountFromAuthToken,   // req.vAuthAccount
                      accountFromParams,      // req.vAccount
                      tokenFromParams,        // req.vToken
                      procDeleteToken,
                      finishMetaverseAPI
                    ] );
```

For this request, `setupMetaverseAPI` sets up the passed `Request` with initial
values (mostly setup for the status/data eventual response).
Then `accountFromAuthToken` looks up the account specified in the `Authorization:`
header and sets the value on `req.vAuthAccount`.
Then `accountFromParams` looks up the account specified in the `:accountId`
URL parameter and sets `req.vAccount`. `tokenFromParams` does the token lookup
for the `:tokenId` parameter.
Then `procDeleteToken` is called which actually does  the delete operation based
on all the collected parameters.
Finally, `finishMetaverseAPI` builds the status/data response for the request.

## Other Implimentation Nodes

BEWARE! All "entity" classes are really just Objects that are read out
of the database. Even though they are defined as classes, when read from the
database, the underlying structure is not converted from the returned
database object into a class instance. Therefore, operations like "instanceOf"
will not work. This is why the entity class definitions don't have constructors
and other instance properties. At best, they have associated const variables.

So that the import statements don't have relative file references, this uses path
aliases. These start with at-signs and are defined in `tsconfig.json`
and `package.json`. The [module-alias] package is used to set the paths
in the compiled JavaScript code. This package is invoked at the top of
`index.ts`;
